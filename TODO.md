# Todo
- Implement double buffering for graphics.
- Make everything return an error value instead of printing the error. Thus moving the responibility of displaying errors to the caller.
    - Also standardize errors, so for example all disk read errors are the same value.
- Implement support for multiple filesystems in the fat driver.
